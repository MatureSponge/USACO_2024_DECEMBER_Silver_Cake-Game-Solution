Sliding window implementation. 

Given that Elsie can only eat cakes on the edge, the maximum number of cakes she can get is N - (N-(N/2-1) cakes. (1 if there are 4 cakes)

Using sliding window (start and end pointers moving together), calculate every single combination of cakes that Elsie can eat. 

Get the maximum Elsie value and subtract it from the total size to calculate how much Bessie gets to eat.
